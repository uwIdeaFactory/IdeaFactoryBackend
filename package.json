The platform will enable users to create a profile, upload project proposals, search for projects based on their skills and interests, collaborate with others, and leave feedback and reviews. The aim of the platform is to foster collaboration and innovation, and to provide a space for individuals to work on projects outside of a traditional classroom or workplace setting.",
